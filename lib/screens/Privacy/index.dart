Note from Medicall: We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy so you feel comfortable with how your information is collected and used in our Service.

INTRODUCTION 

This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is incorporated into our Terms of Use. Therefore, terms used in this Privacy Policy that have been previously defined will have the same meanings as provided in our Terms of Use. As with our Terms of Use, if we make any changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and update the “Last Revised” date of the Privacy Policy. Your use of our Service following any such change means you accept the revised Privacy Policy. 

We are committed to respecting the privacy of users of our Service. We created this Privacy Policy to tell you how Medicall collects, uses and discloses information in order to provide you with our Service. 

In addition, even though Medicall is not a “covered entity” as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), your healthcare Provider assigned through our Service may be a “covered entity” and therefore subject to the provisions of HIPAA. As a result, your Provider has adopted a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (the “Notice of Privacy Practices”) to describe how your Provider uses and discloses your protected health information (“PHI”). In connection with certain services we provide to or on behalf of your Provider, your Provider has requested that we disseminate to you the Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices, which is attached to this Privacy Policy. Medicall has agreed that its collection, use and disclosure of your PHI on behalf of your Provider will be done consistent with the Notice of Privacy Practices except to the extent you have authorized additional uses and disclosures under this Privacy Policy or other provisions of the Terms of Use. 

By accessing or using our Service, you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy; you hereby consent that we will collect, use and disclose your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy; and you acknowledge receipt of your Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices. If you are using our Service on behalf of an individual other than yourself, you represent that you are authorized by such individual to accept this Privacy Policy and the Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices on such individual’s behalf. 

Simply Stated: By using Medicall, you’re agreeing to this Privacy Policy and your Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices.

We and our service providers will obtain information regarding your location or the location of your device through which you access our Service.

USE BY MINORS 

Our Service is intended for use by individuals 18 years of age or older. However, if you are a parent, legal guardian or personal representative of a minor child at least 13 years of age, you may, in compliance with the Terms of Use, use our Service on behalf of such minor child. Any information you provide us on behalf of your minor child will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We do not knowingly collect information for individuals under the age of 13. If we learn that we have received any information for an individual under the age of 13, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child (or a parent, legal guardian or personal representative) to inform him or her that he or she cannot use our Service, and subsequently we will delete that information from our own servers. 

Simply Stated: You must be at least 18 years old to use our Service. However, if you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor at least 13 years old, you may use our Service on behalf of that child.

JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES 

We intend to provide our Service in the United States; accordingly, this Policy, and our collection, use, and disclosure of your information, is governed by U.S. law. We do not represent or warrant that our Service is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. If you choose to access or use our Service from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk. You acknowledge that our Service is subject to U.S. law and consent to the transfer of your information to the United States, which may provide a different level of data security than in the country in which you are located, and you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of your location outside the United States. 

Simply Stated: Our Service is intended for use by U.S. customers living in those states where it is offered. If you use our Service outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk.

THIRD PARTIES 

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including Providers, the manufacturer of your mobile device, and any other third party mobile application or website to which our Service may contain a link. These third parties may at times gather information from or about you. We have no control over the privacy practices of these third parties.

We strive to use reasonable physical, technical and administrative measures to protect information under our control.

If you have reason to believe that the security of your Account has been compromised, please notify us immediately in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below. 

When using our Service, you may choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features you are able to use.

If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.

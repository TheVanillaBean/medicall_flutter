Welcome to Medicall! 

We’re passionate about all the details of providing you with a great experience. In keeping with that goal, we’ve inserted “Simply Stated” explanations throughout our Terms of Use. These explanations are written in a way that makes our Terms of Use easy to understand. That being said, please remember you’re agreeing to all the fine print when you use Medicall, so we encourage you to read our Terms of Use carefully. Our Privacy Policy is included in our Terms of Use, and we take both the privacy and security of your data seriously. Above all else, we value your trust. 

One more thing … our Service is not intended for emergency situations, so if you have a medical emergency, call 911 immediately! 

Thank you for using Medicall. If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at obadri@gmail.com. 


Medicall is an interactive mobile application provided to you by Medicall, Inc. (“Medicall,” “our,” “us,”or “we”). Your access and use of the application or any part thereof, or anything associated with it, including its contents and any products or services provided by Medicall (collectively, the “Service”) are governed by these Terms of Use (this “Agreement”). The Service is intended for access and use only by U.S. customers. Please read this Agreement carefully before using the Service. 

Simply Stated: You must be a U.S. customer to use Medicall. Before using Medicall, please read the Terms of Use.

If we need to change the terms of this Agreement, we will post the revised Terms of Use through our Service and update the “Last Revised” date to reflect the date of the changes. You are responsible for being aware of any changes made to this Agreement. By continuing to use our Service after we post such changes, you agree to the terms of this Agreement, as modified.

WHAT SERVICE DOES MEDICALL PROVIDE? 

Our Service is designed to enable you to obtain telemedicine consultations and treatment for common medical conditions by facilitating the connection between you and a licensed healthcare provider (a “Provider”). Once you select one or more Providers through our Service, each of those Providers may be referred to as “your Provider.” Your Provider is solely responsible for providing you with medical care. We act as a technology platform to connect you with professional healthcare Providers who may be available to provide you with certain non-emergency medical care. We do not control or interfere with the practice of medicine by Providers, each of whom is responsible for the medical services he or she provides. 

Simply Stated: Medicall provides the technology to connect you with licensed healthcare Providers for non-emergency telemedicine consultations, but only your Provider can make decisions about your medical care and treatment.

IS THE SERVICE RIGHT FOR YOU? 

In some cases, our Service may not be the most appropriate way for you to seek medical care and treatment. For example, certain medical conditions may require an in-person procedure or very specialized providers not available through our Service. To assist you in determining whether our Service is a fit for your needs, we ask a series of initial questions during registration before we connect you with a Provider. Based on your responses to these questions, we may determine that our Service is not well suited to the particular issue for which you are seeking treatment. In such a case, you will receive an alert notifying you that you will be unable to use our Service for the particular issue you submitted and providing additional information regarding next steps. If this occurs, your registration will remain on file with Medicall, but you will not be connected with a Provider nor will you have established a physician relationship with any Provider. You will not be charged for any services provided to you in connection with your submission if we are unable to connect you with a Provider. You can return to Medicall at a later time to submit a request for another condition or issue. 

Simply Stated: We may determine that our Service is not appropriate for your particular medical condition or issue. If so, you will be notified that your submission has been halted and you will not be charged for your submission.

MEDICAL EMERGENCIES 

THE MEDICAL CARE YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR PROVIDER THROUGH MEDICALL IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR OTHER MEDICAL TREATMENT YOU MAY NEED. IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL 911 OR SEEK EMERGENCY MEDICAL HELP. 

Simply Stated: Once again, if you have a medical emergency, call 911 immediately!

FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS 

The fees for telemedicine consultations with healthcare Providers can be found on our Service. Fees are subject to change, and may be at the discretion of the provider. It is your responsibility to remain informed about the current rates. Medicall, on behalf of your Provider, will charge you for medical services provided by your Provider, and you agree to pay for all medical services provided to you. 

You will provide Medicall with a valid credit card or any other method of payment accepted by us (“Payment Provider”) when you set up your Account with our Service. By providing Medicall with your Payment Provider and associated payment information, you agree that Medicall is authorized to invoice your Account at the time any payments are due and charge your designated Payment Provider account. If any payments are subject to sales tax in any jurisdiction, you also agree to pay the required sales tax, and any related penalties or interest. Medicall may automatically charge sales taxes for addresses within jurisdictions where such taxes are required. Unless otherwise agreed to by Medicall, all fees paid are non-refundable. You are responsible for all fees and charges associated with your Account. 

We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to charge your Payment Provider account. The processing of payments in connection with your use of our Service will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor and the Payment Provider responsible for your designated method of payment, in addition to this Agreement with Medicall. We are not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor or the Payment Provider. 

At present we do not process any insurance claims, nor will your Provider process claims on your behalf. It is solely up to you to contact your health plan, determine whether your coverage applies, and submit a claim if applicable. You are responsible for the full fee charged for Provider care through our Service regardless of whether you later are able to receive reimbursement from your health plan for part or all of the cost. 

Simply Stated: The current fees for telemedicine consultations with healthcare Providers are posted on Medicall. You agree that Medicall is authorized to bill your account and charge your designated method of payment when payments are due, including any sales tax that may be required. Medicall and your healthcare Provider do not currently process insurance claims, and it is your responsibility to submit claims if your health plan provides coverage.

PRIVACY 

As part of the registration process, you will be asked to provide certain personal information. Any use of such information will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by this reference into these Terms of Use. 

Simply Stated: Our Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Use, so you agree to let us use your information as we’ve described in the Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to control the defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification, and you agree to provide us with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by us. 

Simply Stated: You are responsible for any claims resulting from your violation of these Terms of Use.

MISCELLANEOUS 

These Terms of Use constitute the entire and final agreement between you and Medicall and govern your access to our Service, superseding any prior agreements between us with respect to Terms of Use. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be null and void. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of these Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. Any dispute arising under or relating to these Terms of Use will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except that either party may bring a claim related to intellectual property rights, or seek temporary and preliminary specific performance and injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the posting of bond or other security. The parties agree to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in Boston, Massachusetts, for any action related to these Terms of Use. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and not as part of any class, consolidated or representative action. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right. If any provision is found to be invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action related to these Terms of Use must be filed within one year after such claim arose or be forever barred. You have no authority to act on behalf of or bind Medicall in any way. 

You agree to the use of electronic documents and records in connection with your registration, future transactions and communications involving our Service. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. 

Any use of third-party software provided in connection with our Service, or any third-party product or service accessed or used in connection with our Service, will be governed by the applicable third-party’s license or terms of use, and not by these Terms of Use. If you access our Service from Apple’s App Store, you acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and as such, Apple will have the right to enforce this Agreement. In addition to this Agreement, your use of our Service must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement. 

Any and all provisions of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to be performed after the termination of this Agreement shall survive and be enforceable after such termination, including, without limitation, provisions relating to ownership, indemnification, limitation of liability and governing law. 

Simply Stated: Any dispute related to these Terms of Use that cannot be resolved informally will be resolved by binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. However, please contact us if you have any issues, and we will do our best to take care of them for you. Your satisfaction is our top priority.
